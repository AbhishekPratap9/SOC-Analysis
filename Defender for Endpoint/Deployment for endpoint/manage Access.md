Managing access to data and alerts are a crucial part of controlling, how security framework will work and how company infra will look when hierarchy is created on the basis of roles based permission.
Basically it is created as:
* TIER 1
* TIER 2
* TIER 3<br>
We can create TIER 1 group by clicking roles in permission menu and selecting Add Role:

  * We are giving now alerts investigations and data viewing capabilities to the TIER 1 security team.
  * TIER 2 can have the remediation actions control
  * TIER 3 can manage and change the security settings also.<br><br>

  * Adding the user groups from different groups assigned as TIER 1 in the organization.
* Creating three TIERs and giving their respective permissions and adding user groups from different countries.
