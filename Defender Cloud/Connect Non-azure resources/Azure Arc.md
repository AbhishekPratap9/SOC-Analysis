Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Azure Arc enables you to:

  * Manage your entire environment, with a single platform, by projecting your existing non-Azure, on-premises, or other-cloud resources into Azure Resource Manager.
  * Manage virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they're running in Azure.
  * Use familiar Azure services and management capabilities, regardless of location.
  * Continue using traditional ITOps, while introducing DevOps practices to support new cloud native patterns in your environment.
  * Configure Custom Locations as an abstraction layer on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, cluster connect, and cluster extensions.<br><br>

Azure Arc allows to manage resources types hosted outside of Azure as following:
* Servers - physical and virtual machines of windows or linux
* Kubernetes clusters - multiple kubernetes distributions
* Azure data services - Azure SQL managed & PostgreSQL Hyperscale
* SQL server - Servers on Azure Arc enabled
