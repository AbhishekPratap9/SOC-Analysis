Types of protected databases:
* Azure SQL databases
* SQL servers on machine
* Open-source relational databases(OSS RDB)
* Azure Cosmos DB

This cloud database security protect entire database by detecting attacks, vulnerabilities & Advanced threat protection.
### Two separate defender plans:
* Defender for Azure SQL database servers comprises:
  * Azure SQL Database
  * Azure SQL Managed Instance
  * Dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse

* Defender for SQL servers on machines:<br>
  protections for your Azure-native SQL Servers to fully support hybrid environments and protect SQL servers (all supported version) hosted in Azure, other cloud environments, and even on-premises machines:<br>
  * SQL Server on Virtual Machines
  * On-premises SQL servers:
    * Azure Arc enabled SQL Server (preview)
    * SQL Server running on Windows machines without Azure Arc


### Defender alerts detection for SQL:
* SQL injection attacks : detected when applications generate a faulty SQL statement in the database
* Anomalous database access and query patterns : for ex. abnormally high number of failed sign-in attempts
* Suspicious database activity : SQL server legitimate user just communicated with a suspicious C2 server

### Open-source relational databases:
* Azure Database for PostgreSQL
* Azure Database for MySQL
* Azure Database for MariaDB

* **Defender alerts for open-source relational database:**
  * Anomalous database access and query patterns
  * Suspicious database activities
  * Brute-force attacks

### Azure Cosmos DB
Defender for Azure Cosmos DB continually analyzes the telemetry stream generated by the Azure Cosmos DB service. Detects potential SQL injections, known bad actors based on Microsoft Threat Intelligence, suspicious access patterns, and potential exploitation of your database through compromised identities, or malicious insiders.<br>
* Security alerts are trigerred for azure cosmos DB due to **SQL injection attacks, Database access patterns and suspicious database activity**
