Defender for Containers is the cloud-native solution for securing containers.<br>

### Defender features for containers:
* **Environment hardening :** protects your Kubernetes clusters whether they're running on Azure Kubernetes Service, Kubernetes on-premises / IaaS, or Amazon EKS. By continuously assessing clusters, Defender for Containers provides visibility into misconfigurations and guidelines to help mitigate identified threats
* **Vulnerability assessment :** assessment and management tools for images stored in ACR registries and running in Azure Kubernetes Service
* **Run-time threat protection for nodes and clusters :** Threat protection for clusters and Linux nodes generates security alerts for suspicious activities

### Architecture
The architecture of the elements needed for the full range of protections provided by Defender for Containers, varies depending on where your Kubernetes clusters are hosted, whether they are running in:
* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) :** Microsoft's managed service for developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications
* **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) :** in a connected Amazon Web Services (AWS) account - Amazon's managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes
* **An unmanaged Kubernetes distribution (using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes) :** Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters hosted on-premises or on IaaS.
