Connect and analyze across domains:
APPLICATIONS, ENDPOINTS, IDENTITY & DATA

Threat protection analyze & normalize alerts and connected events across multiple domains 
infusing them into a single incidence for better view and understandibility of events.

Incidence Queue is the central location to prioritize and analyze for the cross-domain attackls and 
alerts prioritizing each one of them by SEVERITY including CATEGORIES & DETECTION SOURCES.
