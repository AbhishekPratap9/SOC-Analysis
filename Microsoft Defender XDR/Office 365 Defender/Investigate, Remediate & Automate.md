Triggering AIR(Automated Investigation & Reponse) capabilities helps to make faster decisions and response on malicious threats 
to the network.

AIR works as:
* An alert is triggered, and an security playbook initiates
* Depending upon the particular alert, security playbook is chosen and AIR triggers the action
  to make the remediation or any suggested changes.
* AIR also collects details & results of the alert and it collects all the related events and
  alerts.
* A playbook log is created to view all the actions that were taken for admin to view.

  In the Alert section you can view all the triggered alerts and clicking on a specific alert
  you can view the more detailed picture and graphs on why and how the alert got triggered.

  AIR can perform certain remediation actions like (these options can be found in the action tab)
  * Soft delete email messages or clusters
  * Block URLs
  * Turn off external mail forwarding
  * turn off delegation
 
    Defender in the Office 365 maps the malicious users, IP, related mails and subsets of that
    emails. It group them together, so that appropriate actions can be taken by the admin or AIR.
