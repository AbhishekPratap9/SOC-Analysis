Conditional access app control let you monitor and control app usage and sessions in real time.<br>
By integrating Entra Conditional Access you can enforce access and session control i.e, <br>
Use conditions that define **who(user / group of user)** , **what(apps)** , & **where(locations & networks)** <br>
a conditional access policy will apply.

_With access and session policies we can provide extra filters for ease of data governance as:_<br>
* Prevent data Exfiltration: Block Download, cut, copy and print for unmanaged device
* Download protection: Instead of blocking, we can label and protect them by choosing the suitable user by setting
  a suitable risk policy for users.
* Unlabelled Documents upload protection: Block a file for upload until the document is classified or labelled.
* User session monitoring: Investigate the user behavior and actions by monitoring their behavior and
  actions they been performing.
* Block Access: Block access for specific apps or users according to the posessed risk.
* Block Custom activity: Certain scenarios are risky for organization or device. for ex. you can scan and check
  the messages sent over the messaging apps and verify them before sending.
