     We can upload upto 20 logs at a time of 1 GB upto 1GB each and they will parse into their separate logs.<br><br>
     After the report is generated of a log you can discover apps, users, IP addresses, their behavior and uses as per your need. <br>

     For more enhanced protection, Advanced Threat protection(ATP) feature can be integrated into Cloud App security,
     enabling this integration forwards ATP signals to cloud app security giving more deeper look into your apps and your shadow IT. It also provide ability to block unauthorized apps.

     ATPs in Cloud Apps security automatically generates continuous reports on schedule if enabled, and identify threats and organization compromises in network.<br><br>

     In the continuos report generated you can see the machines, users, IPs, etc. and coorelate them according to the incidence being investigated.<br><br>
     Apps differentiated in the report are marked Red to green, being Risky to safe. 
      A Green score on app mean that the app is sanctioned and safe, you can also view the risk factors as shown for Office 365.

     After marking the Unsafe apps as Unsanctioned, you can generate Block scripts, and import it to your appliance and prevenet users from using those apps, You can mark block unsanctioned apps and ATP will block the apps,Block scripts can be generated for network appliances that can block the use of apps from users. For example you can generate this script for a Firewall that wil prevent users from using unsafe apps.
