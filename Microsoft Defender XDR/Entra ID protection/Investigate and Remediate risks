Investigations is done by reports generated by the risk-policies set by you as:
* Risky Sign-ins - Location details, device details,signins with risks ,etc.

* Risky Users - List of Users at risk and users with dismissed risks. User history of risky sign-ins.

Actions that admins can take on :

* Risky sign-in - Confirm the sign-in are safer or confirm it is compromised or not.
* Risky Users - Reset user passwords, dismiss user risk, block user sign-ins, and confirm user accounts 
                as compromised.

Another methods for remediation are Self-remediation, Reset passwords manually

Unblock the user after remediation and if they are facing issues, Dismiss user risk detections or Close individual 
detection can be tried.
